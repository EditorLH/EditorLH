  <h6>How is a page calculated? (p/p)</h6>
  <p>A page, for purposes of calculating the tariff is: Arial 12, 1.5 spacing. If your document is in single or double spacing, this will be adjusted only for purposes of calculating the quote. Thereafter, the spacing, font and size of the text will be converted back to that which you prefer / that which is prescribed by your institution.</p>
  ​
  <h6>How long does an edit take?</h6>
  <p>Approximately 4 weeks, although it may be completed sooner, according to the schedule of the Editor. It will not take longer than 4 weeks. Urgent or priority edits may be completed sooner, at an escalated tariff of an additional R10.00 p/p.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Are track changes enabled?</h6>
  <p>Upon request, track changes are enabled. If track changes are not enabled, the Editor will indicate changes made in, for example, yellow or red. Track changes often make the editing of footnotes burdensome. It is for this reason that it is generally not used. The comment section in the Word document is also employed to indicate comments, suggestions, amendments or additional changes. Upon request, a comparative PDF will be generated (free of charge), indicating the changes between the original document and the edited document.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Do I have to accept the changes of the Editor?</h6>
  <p>No. As the author of the work, you have the choice of accepting or rejecting the amendments or edits of the Editor.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Will I be charged for a blank page?</h6>
  <p>No.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Can I secure a slot?</h6>
  <p>Yes. A 50% deposit is payable to secure a future slot for proofreading and editing. Read more here...</p>
  ​
  <h6>I have decided not to proceed with proofreading and editing. Will I be refunded the deposit?</h6>
  <p>Yes, only if no edits have already been made. You will be charged for the work that has already been done. Read more here...</p>
  ​
  <h6>Is my work confidential?</h6>
  <p>Yes. Read more here...</p>
  ​
  <h6>Is proofreading and editing ethical?</h6>
  <p>Copy editing forms a part of the standard legal academia and practice. The role and capacity  of the Editor is limited to the editing of language, style, referencing, grammar and citation. This means that the Editor does not comment or change the substance, merits, structure or arguments of the Author. The Author retains the copyright in the work. The Editor does not assist in a co-author capacity.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Can you help me with my research proposal?</h6>
  <p>The Editor cannot assist the Author with the substance, content, merits or argument of the research proposal. Only once the Author has completed the research proposal, can the Editor edit this. The Editor will then, for example, edit the language, style, grammar, punctuation, use of tenses etc. The Editor will not make any comments, suggestions or amendments regarding the merit, substance or arguments in the research proposal.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Why is proofreading and editing important?</h6>
  <p>Proofreading and editing is essential. The most important part of academic writing is consistency. The Editor provides the finishing touches to the document. This means that the Editor ensures that the language, style, referencing, citation, page numbers, headings, table of contents, bibliography, footnotes and paragraph numbering is top-notch and ready for submission / publication.</p>
  ​
  <h6>According to which style and referencing guide must my work be edited?</h6>
  <p>The style and referencing guide, as provided by your institution or faculty. For example, the PULP Style Guide, NWU Law Style Guide, PER/PELJ, De Jure, Harvard, Oxford, UKZN, SALJ, Stell LR, UNISA etc.</p>
  ​
  <h6>Why does it take 4 weeks?</h6>
  <p>Professional proofreading and editing (language and style) takes a minimum of four (4) weeks based on the schedule of the Editor. This is because some edits require more attention to detail, as well as a re-reading and "re"-editing of the entire document (especially LLD). In the event that an edit is urgent, it may be completed sooner.</p>

  <h6>Can you write my research proposal/dissertation?</h6>
  <p>No. As a language and style editor, my duties are restricted to the language and style editing of the work. It will amount to gross academic dishonesty (or, even plagiarism) if the Editor completes the work on behalf of the Author.</p>

    <p>
      <img class="alert-image" src="images\alert.gif" alt="alert">
      <p class="h6-custom">The Editor will let you know what the approximate timeline of completion is. The timeframe for completing your edit is based on the urgency of the edit, the length of the document, as well as the quality of your work (for example, peer-review reports - relating to language and style - have already been incorporated in the amendments of the work).</p>
      <p class="h6-custom">In order for the Editor to produce "publication ready" proofread and edit(s), it is essential that the Editor is provided with sufficient time to proofread and edit the work. Shorter time-frames, as well as the prior commitments of the Editor, may mean that the work might not be proofread, and edited, according to the Author's time-frame.</p>
      <p class="h6-custom">It is essential that you make ample provision for proofreading and editing!</p>
